  How's your feeling when you have only five minutes to pass from heaven to
  hell? Photos: Andrea Bigiarini Camera: Sony A6000 Five concentrated minutes
  where every second seems to let every meaning for a frozen suspended space.
  You can breathe and feel this sensation on the holy sands of Santa Croce
  during the last five minutes you pass in heaven.
